# My Project: Streaming Paradise Website
Welcome to **Streaming Paradise Website**!

This is a customly built web page for centeralizing my streaming content,
combining **YouTube** and **Twitch** in one semi-professional, and user-friendly website. Fans can see latest streams, highlights, schedules, updates-all in one place, and possibly even some sneak-peak videos I might be working on.
